This is the group repository for our project "Tier List Maker Ultimate".

## Vision Statement
#### Summary Sentence
TierList Maker Ultimate is a tier list creation tool where users will be able to create and share their own completed lists or list templates. 
	
#### Basic Description
Tier lists are a commonly used method online used to compare and rank different items in a certain order. Our app will allow users to create these lists. Users will be able to accomplish this by dragging and dropping items into their respective tiers much like how they would in similar tier list creation apps.
	
#### Intended Audience
We intend for this to be usable for anyone who may want to create a tier list, so we will include features that appear in other apps that are used to make tier lists such as editing tier names, exporting lists to an image, and utilizing custom templates. But we have additional features catered towards people who wish to share their lists but do not have the proper online platform to provide explanations for their choice of ranking. 
	
#### Value to users
A problem with other tier list makers is that when a user shares the list, it is only an image. This can lead to someone seeing a list and not understanding why an item is ranked the way it is. You would have to make a video with explanations and upload it on some other platform. But not everyone has an online audience and someone that sees the list is not guaranteed to see the explanation video.

With our app, users will be able to couple their reasoning straight into the list itself and then post it on our sharing network to be seen by other users or they can externally link to it so people can go see the explanations. We will also still provide the ability to export as PNG for those users who have a platform, or who simply don't care to explain themselves.
	
#### Success Criteria
Success will be measured by the average upload count of templates or completed lists per user in a month. Our goal of this statistic is an average of 3 uploads per user. At that point, we feel that users are satisfied with the app.
