This is the group repository for our project "Tier List Maker Ultimate".

## Vision Statement
Tier List Maker Ultimate is a tier list creation tool where users will be able to create and share their own completed lists or list templates. 

Tier lists are a commonly used method online used to compare and rank different items in a certain order. Our app will allow users to create these lists. Users will be able to accomplish this by intuitively organizing and ranking images into their respective tiers much like how they would in similar tier list creation apps.

The intended audience for this app is anyone who may want to create a tier list, this may include people like content creators, gamers, and people who are part of online communities. We plan to include features that appear in tier list makers to make using our app as intuitive as possible to such people who may already be familiar with those other makers. These features include editing tier names and colors, exporting lists to an image, and utilizing custom templates. But we have additional features catered towards people who wish to share their lists with others but do not have the proper online platform to provide explanations for their choice of ranking. 

A problem with other tier list makers is that when a user shares the list, it is only an image, so any viewers can only take it at face value. This can lead to a situation where the placement of an item in a less subjective ranking does not match the thoughts of the viewer, and they think the list maker does not know what they are talking about. When if they could see the explanation, they might be able to understand the placement better. To fix this, the creator of the list would have to make a video or text with explanations and upload it on some other platform. But not everyone has an online audience and someone that sees the list is not guaranteed to see the explanation.

With our app, users will be able to couple their reasoning straight into the list itself and then post it on our sharing network to be seen by other users or they can externally link to it so people can go see the explanations. We will also still provide the ability to export as PNG for those users who have a platform, or who simply don't care to explain themselves.

Success will be measured by the average upload count of templates or completed lists per user in a month. The goal for this statistic is an average of 3 uploads per user. At that point, we feel that users are satisfied with the app.
